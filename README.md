# Rizin

Rizin is a fork of the radare2 reverse engineering framework with a focus on
usability, working features and code cleanliness.

Rizin is portable and it can be used to analyze binaries, disassemble code,
debug programs, as a forensics tool, as a scriptable command-line hexadecimal
editor able to open disk files, and much more!

To learn more on Rizin you may want to read the
[official Rizin book](https://book.rizin.re).

# How to install

Look at [install instructions](https://rizin.re/install/) on our web page.

# How to build

Use `meson` to compile and install Rizin. Please make sure to get an updated
`meson` (e.g. get it with `pip install meson` if your system does not provide
one that is at least version 0.55.0).

Clone this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin
```

Then compile and install with:
```
$ meson build
$ ninja -C build
$ sudo ninja -C build install
```

Now you can use `rizin`:
```
$ rizin
 -- Thank you for using rizin. Have a nice night!
[0x00000000]>

```

To uninstall rizin, execute `sudo ninja -C build uninstall`.


Please have a look at [BUILDING.md][] for more information about building Rizin.
